# React TryOut Repo
This repo contains stuff I create to expand my React knowledge.


## React Hooks Gallery
Based on Ryan Florence [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wXLf18DsV-I) at React Confg 2018 I have messed around with a gallery for eventual later reuse.


### Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
